# OpenAI.el
> Elisp library for the OpenAI API

[![CI](https://github.com/emacs-openai/openai/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emacs-openai/openai/actions/workflows/test.yml)

The OpenAI Elisp library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from
applications written in the Elips language. 

*P.S. This package is expected to be used as a library, so there are only a few
interactable commands you can use, and those are mostly examples.*

## 🔨 Usage

You will need to set up your API key before you can use this library.

```elisp
(setq openai-key "[YOUR API KEY]")
```

### The simplest example

Here is the simplest example that teaches you how to use this library. This is 
a function with a `query` and a callback function.

```elisp
(openai-completion "How are you?"
                   (lambda (data)
                     (message "%s" data)))
```

### 📝 Customization

Most arguments are extracted (excepts the required one) as global variables.
For example, one variable `openai-completon-n` is defined in `openai-completion.el`
file. That variable is used for the completion request, for more information see
https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions. The naming convention is
by the following pattern:

```
[PACKAGE NAME]-[API TYPE]-[NAME OF THE ARGUMENT]
```

For example:

```elisp
(setq openai-edit-temperature 1)
```

- `openai` - is the package name
- `edit` - is the api type, see [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
- `temperature` - is the argument for the [Edit](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits) request.

You can change the model for a single request without changing its global value.

```elisp
(let ((openai-edit-model "text-davinci-edit-001")  ; use another model for this request,
      (openai-edit-n 3))                           ; and i want three outcomes
  (openai-edit-create "What day of the wek is it?"
                      "Fix the spelling mistakes"
                      (lambda (data)
                        (message "%s" data))))
```

### 📢 API functions

The API functions are followed by this pattern:

```
[PACKAGE NAME]-[API TYPE]-[REQUEST NAME]
```

For example:

```elisp
(openai-file-list ...)
```

- `openai` - is the package name
- `file` - is the api type, see [OpenAI API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)
- `list` - is the request name

### 🖥 Setting Model

You can also choose which model you want to use by going to the 
[api](https://api.openai.com/v1/models) website and looking at the id's. 
For code usage you probably want something that starts with `code-` whereas 
with more text related files you'll likely want something starting with `text-`.

```elisp
(setq openai-completion-model "NAME-HERE")
```
