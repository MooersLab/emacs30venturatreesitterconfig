#+Title: Emacs Configuration with Support for Structured Editing

** Purpose

This configuration supports structured editing of computer code with concrete syntax trees. 
The built-in package tree-sitter and the new package combobulate support this kind of editing.
Emacs has to be compiled with support for tree-sitter.
See [[https://github.com/MooersLab/emacs30macos13treesitter][this repo]] for a protocol for compiling Emacs from source code on macOS.

This configuration file is also a rewrite of my basic configuration file with the packages in use listed at the top to speed up the start-up of Emacs.
The *package* package is used to install the missing packages rather than 
*use-package*, but *use-package* is still used to customize packages and load packages when needed.
This massive rearrangement reduced the start-up time by about 30%.
Many thanks go to Jeff Bowman for this suggestion.

The *init.el* file was developed on Ventura (macOS 13.2), but it should be transferrable to older Mac operating systems.
There are several Mac specific lines in the basic configuration section that can be quickly switched for Linux or Windows.


** Features

The content of the configuration file supports my academic research writing with occassional code writing for research purposes.

- Configured for structured editing combobulate and tree-sitter.
- Uses the Vertico and friends for completion.
- Supports org-mode, org-agenda, org-babel, and org-roam.
- Support pdf-tools.
- Uses booksmarks+, dired+, and iscicles (off by default). These require custom installation.  

** What the landing page (dashboard) will resemble when first loaded

The default image for the dashboard is the Emacs logo. 
I subsituted another image that is included above for testing.

The startup time should be shorter on Linux and longer on Windows. 

I tried zsh and bash. There was no difference in startup time.

Note that bookmarks are normally accessed via the *bookmarks list* buffer, but some can be listed on the dashboard automatically.
Also note that the bookmarks can be to directories and PDFs.
Clicking on the icon in the dashboard of the PDF of a book opens the book in Emacs for immediate reading. 
The dashboard is a way of keeping track of material that needs to be read soon.
