#+Title: Emacs Configuration File with Support for Structured Editing

* Purpose

This configuration supports structured editing of code with concrete syntax trees. 
The built-in package tree-sitter and the new package combobulate support this kind of editing.
Emacs has to be compiled with support for tree-sitter.
See [[][this repo]] for a protocol for compiling Emacs from source on macOS.

This configuration file is also a rewrite of my basic configuration file with the packages in use listed at the top to speed up the start-up of Emacs.
The `package` package is used to install the missing packages rather than `use-package`, but `use-package` is still used to customize packages and load packages when needed.
This rearrangement reduced the start-up time by about 30%.

This init.el file was developed on Ventura (macOS 13.2), but it should be tranferrable to older Mac operating systems.
There are several Mac specific lines in the basic configuration section that can be quickly switched for Linux or Windows.
